The implementation utilizes a Dispatcher/Worker Model to efficiently handle concurrent task
execution in Linux using C programming language. At the core of the solution lies the
initialization process, where the dispatcher initializes by parsing command-line arguments
and spawning worker threads. This initialization process ensures that the necessary
resources, such as counter files and worker threads, are set up before the main execution
begins.

Counter files are created during initialization, with each counter file representing a specific
counter used throughout the program. These counter files are crucial for accurately tracking
and updating counter values during program execution. By utilizing counter files, the solution
ensures data integrity and persistence across multiple program runs.
Worker threads are created during initialization and remain active throughout the program's
execution. These threads are responsible for executing queued jobs offloaded by the
dispatcher. Each worker thread operates independently, executing commands serially within
a job. Synchronization mechanisms, such as mutexes and condition variables, are employed
to ensure thread safety and prevent race conditions when accessing shared resources, such
as the work queue.

The implementation includes a shared work queue where worker jobs are queued for
execution. This work queue acts as a buffer between the dispatcher and worker threads,
allowing for efficient task distribution and load balancing. Worker jobs are queued in the
work queue as command lines read from the input command file. Each command line is
parsed, and if it represents a worker job, it is enqueued in the work queue for execution by
an available worker thread.

Logging capabilities are incorporated into the solution to trace the execution flow and
provide insights into program behavior. Each worker thread opens a log file to record job
start and end times, facilitating debugging and performance analysis. Additionally, the
dispatcher logs command reading from the input file, providing a comprehensive record of
program execution.

Upon completing command file processing, the dispatcher waits for all pending background
commands to complete before calculating and displaying statistics. These statistics, including
total running time, sum, min, average, and max job turnaround times, offer valuable insights
into program performance and efficiency.
